My first R markdown file
========================

This is my first R markdown file.

Here we're going to load some data

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a pairs plot of the data

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model on ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's an unordered list:

* first element
* second element
Here's an ordered list:

1. first element
5. second element
